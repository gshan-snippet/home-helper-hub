## Key Implementation Details

### 1. User Type Based Navigation
Navigation dynamically changes based on user role:
- **Operator**: Home → Posts → Messages → Profile
- **Consumer**: Home → Workers → Messages → Profile
- **Not Logged In**: Home → Login

### 2. Session Storage
User data is stored in browser's sessionStorage:
```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem("userId", user.id);
sessionStorage.setItem("userEmail", user.email);
sessionStorage.setItem("userName", user.name);
sessionStorage.setItem("userRole", user.role);
sessionStorage.setItem("userPhone", user.phone);
```

### 3. Image Handling
- Posts require before/after images (uploaded to backend/uploads)
- Images served via static route: `/uploads/[filename]`
- File format: Any image type (jpg, png, etc.)

### 4. Message Types
- **Regular Messages**: Text-based communication
- **Appointment Requests**: Special message format with appointment details

## Troubleshooting

### Backend not starting
- Check if port 3001 is already in use
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` from backend folder

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Ensure backend is running on http://localhost:3001
- Check CORS is enabled (it is in server.js)
- Check browser console for error messages

### Images not uploading
- Make sure /backend/uploads folder exists
- Check file size isn't too large (50MB limit)
- Verify image file format is supported

### Messages not appearing
- Refresh the page
- Check that you're logged in
- Ensure operator ID matches (should be "operator-1")
